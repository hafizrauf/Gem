He was ordained a priest in 1776 and joined the staff at the Brera Observatory of the Jesuit college in Milan as an assistant astronomer. Napoleon appointed him director of this Milan Observatory in 1802. Napoleon also appointed him to participate in measuring the arc of meridian between zeniths of Rimini and Rome. Oriani was honored by being named a corresponding member of the French Academy of Science, Fellow of the Royal Society and member of the Berlin Academy. He was associated with Theatine monk Piazzzi in astronomical studies for over 37 years; used his calculations to prove that Uranus is a planet rather than a comet. He published his tables of Uranus in 1795, some of which appear to be in the present manuscript. Poggendorff provides extensive list of Oriani's dissertation and writings in astronomy. (Poggend.

He went on to found and organize the State Audit Council, according to French ideals, and became its first chairman. He also assisted in the Foundation of the National Bank of Greece in 1841. Arthémond de Régny got married in 1798 to the Genoese woman, Catherine Castellini, who was the daughter of Balthasar and granddaughter of Domenico Castellini who conquered the Algerians in 1763. Balthasar Castellini was consul to Naples and subsequently in Cartagena (Spain), Marseille and Genoa. He was in charge of important missions by the royal court of Naples, and also held an outstanding position in the trade. The family Régny was originally from the province of Dombes. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Francois Régny established his family in Genoa, where he was in charge of the \""Direction of the diplomats for the King.\, nan, The present set of volumes provides an extensive collection of Golgi's major works on neurons and numerous other cells as well as his research on malaria. Golgi introduced a selective silver stain that stained individual neuronal cells and a discrete reticulate structure inside cells, subsequently called the Golgi Apparatus. With his staining method, Golgi was able to study \""of the finer anatomy of the nervous system. Using this technique, he identified Golgi's Type I and Type II nerve cells and did other detailed studies of the cerbrum, spinal cord, and olfactory system. Golgi later determined the correct course of the uriniferous tubules and their relation to the glomeruli of the kidney. In 1886, only a few years after Laveran's discovery of the malaria parasite, Golgi described the parasites of the tertian and quartan fevers and their nonsexual development. Together with Ramón y Cajal, Golgi was awarded the Nobel prize in 1906 for their many contributions into man's understanding of the structure and function of the nervous system.\"" (Heirs of Hipporcrates, p. 611 no. 2056) .This is an exceptionally scarce publication of Golgi's research, much of which only appeared as journal articles, with only 350 copies printed., nan, nan, This is another page-for-page reprint of the text of the 1604 edition. The publisher is the same as that of the 1615 edition, his device appearing on both title-pages (Doe, p. 197). Doe also points out that the Dutch editions were fare superior to the ?very inferior? Latin edition. In addition, the Dutch editions used the same woodblocks used for the French editions minus ?a few historical woodcuts, which the printer left out by ?the translator?s advice because they were not instructive and would have encumbered the book?? (Doe, pp.193- 194)., Provenance: bookplate of Harold Hulme Brindley. He was a British zoologist, educated at St. John?s College, Cambridge where he took honours in the Natural Sciences Tripos in 1888. He aided Weldon and Bateson in a period largely devoted to measurements designed to ascertain the technique of natural selection. He also contributed to the study of variation of the Mollusca and the Orthoptera group of insects, and acted as an Examiner in zoology at Glasgow University, 1915-18 and 1925-6. He was also a Fellow of St John's, and, from 1914 to 1923, Steward of the College. Brindley was deeply interested in shipping, and rose to distinction as a nautical archaeologist. He was a founding member of the Navy Records Society and of the Society for Nautical Research, serving as its Vice-President. In 1935 he was Head of the Seal Room of the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. (Nature 153, 309, 1944; ODNB) (Henrey 299; Hunt 340; Wing P2388)., nan, nan, nan, Very good copy of this scarce title. This is the....., The majority of the manuscript pages appear to deal with quadratic forms in Leonard Dickson's - Studies in the theory of numbers. (1930), which contains numerous original investigations in the theory of quadratic forms in three or four variables. In Dickson's earlier work on the History of the Theory of Numbers (1919-23) he provided little interpretation and made no attempt to contextualize the results being described. It is probably with this background that Kraitchik devoted much of the manuscript sheets to Dickson's work. Other manuscript notes dealing with other equations from Euler \""Continuous la table\"" dated March to December, 1939. The last group of manuscript pages in 8vo deal with equations from a publication of Landar(sic) Backman dated November 1931 and May 1938. There are a few loose sheets with calculations but no identification. These may be sheets used to make rough calculations. Together this manuscript collection and off prints offer a very good example of Kraitchik's thinking in regards the theory of numbers. Although Kraitchik is often thought of in relation to Recreational Mathematics, he really spent considerable time with the Theory of Numbers. The present collection of 3 off prints and manuscript sheets most of which are on, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, Since Linnaeus thought much of the contents of the Stockholm Pharmacopoeia was useless for treating ailments, he modernised the list and motivated his choices in his Materia medica. This and his two subsequent books were used in the teaching of medicine and pharmacology for several decades all over Europe (which at that time was considered the whole world). Linnaeus also wrote several theses on medicines and pharmaceutical control, for example how to determine the quality and usefulness of medicinal plants by using taste and smell and also to make sure that the product was not too old. Linnaeus? Materia Medica also acted as a jolt to the Swedish medical authorities that it was time to modernise medicine and just over twenty-five years later the book Pharmacopoea Svecica was published in 1775 ? it was the first national Swedish Pharmacopoeia. In his botanical garden, Linnaeus kept all the important medicinal plants that could be grown in Sweden as well as many plants that he wanted to observe as a botanist. He used the garden to demonstrate medicinal plants and botany to the medical students. (\""Linné? Upsula Univ. website) (Soulsby, 968)., nan, nan, nan, The details in the text for different maps vary but capture the essence of the country or region and the native people. Although the color maps are not very detailed, they have a real aesthetic value and reflect the world viewed by the French bourgeoisie of the nineteenth century. The atlas is in good condition and shows the real artistic talent of its Marie Ponson. There are two printed religious documents inserted loose at front. These documents record the day when Marie Ponson received her first communion in the Catholic Church and when she was officially consecrated to the Order of St. Vierge in 1882. She originally entered the order in 1878, which suggests that the preparation of the Atlas was undertaken after Marie Ponson was formally made a Sister of the Order of the Blessed Virgin (Ste Vierge) in 1882., nan, nan, Bizzozero (1846-1901) referred in his essay on a new form component of the blood and its role in thrombosis and coagulation, the platelets, as he called the platelets, as the third independent form component of two to three times smaller diameter than the erythrocytes circulating beside them and the white blood cells in the blood. However, the question of thrombocytogenesis could not really be solved until 1906 by James H. Wright (1869-1928), who observed the formation of platelets from constrictions on the pseudopodia of the megakaryocytes of the bone marrow. A further stimulation of the biostimulatory research by Bizzozero resulted from the fact that he brought the platelets 5in connection with the blood clotting. They, and not the white blood cells, played the main role in the coagulation, because it was likely that the platelets were not only involved in the pathological thrombosis. Bizzozero proposed a bridge to Virchow's view in 1882 with the conclusion that \""their proliferation would alter the conditions of the circulation, and it is probable that in such cases the slightest alteration of the walls of the vessel may give rise to widespread thrombosis\"". Cf. Axel W.Bauer & Kerstin Mall, H- MOSTASE, THROMBOSE AND EMBOLISM. Historical, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, This is a rare color copy of Lee's \""original work that constituted the first treatise of treatise of the Linnaean system in England.\"" (Stafleu & Cowan 4289). There is dedication to James Edward Smith by James Lee the Younger followed by Thornton's essay on James Lee. There are VIII Tables complementing the translation of text for the twenty four Linnean Classes, Appendix on Palms, five (5) chapters on Genera and, in Part Third, twenty three (23) chapters on plant types, i.e. vegetables divisible into families or tribes, all parts of plants, seeds and various aspects of growth, germination and fine structures found on plants, ending with types of inflorescence and other morphological features on plants that permitting distinction of species and their varieties . The remaining portion of the book contains tables that include portions of the Termini Botanici: A dictionary of botanical terms for use of students in botany. \""Lee (1715-1795) was gardener at Syon House, Middlesex and to Duek of Argyll at Whitton, Middleses. He also was partner with J. Kennedy in Vineyard Nursery, Hammersmith around 1745. He had a number of plant collectors providing plants from America and at the Cape (Horn?). He was a correspondent of, nan, Louis Boehmer, was a German citizen who migrated to America in around 1866, working as a gardener in Rochester, New York. In 1872 he moved to Japan and became head of a government-owned American run farming operation. After the breakup of the farm he established his own nursery in 1882, specializing in exporting Japanese plants and bonsai to Europe, the United States and Australia. In 1890 Boehmer sold his nursery to his partner Albert Unger., The classification criteria is given by the external form, judged by Battarra to be a more certain and practical method of classification, than that used by Gleditsch in his Methodus fungorum of 1753.

SOTAB_68.csv,review,"nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, I couldn't believe \""The Dark knight\"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. \""The Dark Knight\"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want., Honestly all I can say is that this film was not what I was expecting and far exceeded my expectations. The chemistry between the actors and also the visual story is absolutely stunning and I'm just wowed by how well done everything is done in this film. I can't say I have anything bad to say about this film. And please go into this movie without spoilers, I find that it is way more enjoyable to be surprised by the actual story and leaves more excitement for the viewer., I have a very hard time picking a favorite, favorite film, but if forced to create a Top 10 List, this film would be there. Yes, Liza Minnelli CAN act , and brilliantly. The songs are wonderful and funny, the narrative is brilliant and dark. Those who typically don't like musicals might enjoy this, as there are none of those cheesy \""I feel a song coming on\"" moments - - all of the music is confined to the stage of the Kit Kat Klub. Michael York's role is often overshadowed by Minnelli's brassy Sally Bowles, but his work is equally strong. A., Shame I can't rate this 0/10. Movie could of been good if not for some people clearly pushing a political opinion but in the end everything was awful, the timing of the jokes, no expression or any kind of physical comedy when saying the jokes, everything was just awful. Could of tried to make it a little bit less obvious that is movie isn't really about the movie at all lol. I was excited for this, but honestly, worst film I've watched in a long time. Hatchet was better and that was a mere time killer and awful at the same time. I wouldn't even watch this again if I was in a hospital bed, rather be in silence and doing nothing., Sunday was my niece's birthday. 16. I invited her and two of her friends to do whatever they wanted. They chose to stay home, eat cake and watch The Greatest Showman on HBO and I thought Oh no. But, I had cake with them and sat to watch this Michael Gracy, who? Michael Gracy to see the story of PT Barnum with Hugh Jackman. Sentimental and pretty, yes but also, engrossing, moving, beautiful and structured in such a way that doesn't fall into the usual biopic traps. It moves at a breathless pace with smart and unexpected transitions. Hugh Jackman is great and Michelle Williams truthful to a fault. She's never less than that. What a wonderful actress. Zac Effron gives, what it may very well be, his most convincing performance and the Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson was a revelation to me. The script by Jenny Bicks and the remarkable Bill Condon tells a classic tale with contemporary rhythms and contemporary pace. Needless to say, I enjoyed it much more that I could possibly had imagine. So, thank you Lilli, happy 16!, Let me start by saying that the performances are solid. Not mind blowing but solid. For her first film, Lady Gaga did very well but I can't say she blew my mind...but hey it's her first film and I like her, so good for her. That being said, the film seems to be getting WAY overblown by people. The first act is really great and the chemistry between Gaga and Cooper is phenomenal but after that it sort of devolves into a melodrama. The character development of Cooper's character is lacking. He is an alcoholic and we certainly see him drunk many times but I didn't see enough struggle to justify his character arc not was Cooper's performance powerful enough to convey the devastating agony of addiction. The film then goes through a few cliches as we see Gaga's character ascend to fame but again, we also don't see enough struggle from her character either. In all, the character conflicts are addressed but the film never fully dives into them in the way it certainly could have. I loved the first song of the film but the rest of the music was surprisingly bland and didn't captivate me at all., This was supposed to be the newest and best Marvel movie. It was also supposed to be deeper than a super hero movie. Well, basically all they did was put African-Americans in the role of the main characters and followed the same exact formula of every other Marvel movie ever created. The action was mediocre at best. The villain was good, but at the point when he truly started to flesh out his character, I was bored and realized I was watching a movie. I literally said what was going to happen about 30 minutes before it happened. Now if you like super hero films, which I happen to not, I am sure you will have fun and enjoy this film. But, in my opinion this movie had th intensity of a haircut and was a boring commercial to sell toys., Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while. Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it. The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion. During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself. The cast, I liked this movie and it's way of storytelling is really great. I love that stlye of more different stories that are somehow connected. Amores Perros is my favorite movie from Inarritu just beacuse of that storytelling (and I'm not fan of Birdman). Brad Pitt delivers another great performance. My favorite sequence of movie is Korean one and it's perfectly made. I think Inarritu should return to this style rather than his new one...",review_Movie

Combining formal purity and freedom of tone, the quintet was hailed as a masterly creation and has remained his most successful chamber work. In the last years of a long and productive life, he composed a cycle of songs with piano trio, innovative in both form and structure, a hymn to art, friendship and nature possessing extraordinary evocative power. To tackle these major works of the twentieth century, the Trio Wanderer has chosen partners of the calibre of Catherine Montier, Christophe Gaugué, and an expert in Russian vocal music, Ekaterina Semenchuk., nan, nan, nan, For all their supreme refinement of inspiration, Purcell?s melodies retain a very direct charm, thus perpetuating a tradition of English song born with the Elizabethan madrigalists, which has come down to us through the incomparable voice and artistic commitment of Alfred Deller., nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, King Arthur (1691), like Purcell?s other great scores for the stage, belongs to a highly unusual genre: it is neither a play nor an opera but a hybrid of the two known as ?semi-opera?.

T2DV2_131.csv,Unnamed: 2,"""by convention bitter, by convention sweet, but in reality atoms and void"", Proposed a mechanical universe with small solid masses in motion., Proposed an ""atomic theory"" with spherical solid atoms based upon measurable properties of mass., Studied the effect of electricity on solutions, coined term ""electrolysis"" as a splitting of molecules with electricity, developed laws of electrolysis. Faraday himself was not a proponent of atomism., Built one of the first gas discharge tubes (""cathode ray tube"")., Arranged elements into 7 groups with similar properties. He discovered that the properties of elements ""were periodic functions of the their atomic weights"". This became known as the Periodic Law., Proposed electric and magnetic fields filled the void., Discovered cathode rays had the following properties: travel in straight lines from the cathode; cause glass to fluoresce; impart a negative charge to objects they strike; are deflected by electric fields and magnets to suggest a negative charge; cause pinwheels in their path to spin indicating they have mass., Used a CRT to study ""canal rays"" which had electrical and magnetic properties opposite of an electron., Proposed that electricity was made of discrete negative particles he called electrons "". (Link to info on electrons), Using a CRT he observed that nearby chemicals glowed. Further experiments found very penetrating rays coming from the CRT that were not deflected by a magnetic field. He named them ""X-rays""., While studying the effect of x-rays on photographic film, he discovered some chemicals spontaneously decompose and give off very pentrating rays., Used a CRT to experimentally determine the charge to mass ratio (e/m) of an electron =1.759 x 10 8 coulombs/gram., Studied ""canal rays"" and found they were associated with the proton H  ., Studied radiations emitted from uranium and thorium and named them alpha and beta., Studied uranium and thorium and called their spontaneous decay process ""radioactivity"". She and her husband Pierre also discovered the radioactive elements polonium and radium., Observed spontaneous disintegration of radioactive elements into variants he called ""isotopes"" or totally new elements, discovered ""half-life"", made initial calculations on energy released during decay., used the idea of quanta (discrete units of energy) to explain hot glowing matter., Postulated a ""Saturnian"" model of the atom with flat rings of electrons revolving around a positively charged particle., Discovered that inert gases had a stable electron configuration which lead to their chemical inactivity., Published the famous equation E=mc 2, Developed an electrical device to ""click"" when hit with alpha particles., Oil drop experiment determined the charge (e=1.602 x 10 -19 coulomb) and the mass (m = 9.11 x 10 -28 gram) of an electron., Using alpha particles as atomic bullets, probed the atoms in a piece of thin (0.00006 cm) gold foil . He established that the nucleus was: very dense,very small and positively charged. He also assumed that the electrons were located outside the nucleus., Using x-ray tubes, determined the charges on the nuclei of most atoms. He wrote""The atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons in the nucleus"". This work was used to reorganize the periodic table based upon atomic number instead of atomic mass., Discovered the existence of isotopes through the use of a mass spectrograph., Developed an explanation of atomic structure that underlies regularities of the periodic table of elements. His atomic model had atoms built up of sucessive orbital shells of electrons., Discovered that electrons had a dual nature-similar to both particles and waves. Particle/wave duality. Supported Einstein., Described atoms by means of formula connected to the frequencies of spectral lines. Proposed Principle of Indeterminancy - you can not know both the position and velocity of a particle., Built an early linear accelerator and bombarded lithium with protons to produce alpha particles, Viewed electrons as continuous clouds and introduced ""wave mechanics"" as a mathematical model of the atom., Proposed anti-particles . Anderson discovered the anti-electron (positron) in 1932 and Segre/Chamberlain detected the anti-proton in 1955.., Using alpha particles discovered a neutral atomic particle with a mass close to a proton. Thus was discovered the neutron., Conducted experiments verifying that heavy elements capture neutrons and form unstable products which undergo fission. This process ejects more neutrons continuing the fission chain reaction., Synthesized 6 transuranium elements and suggested a change in the layout of the periodic table., Conducted the first controlled chain reaction releasing energy from the atoms nucleus., Follow this link to current theories about atomic stucture.",Scientist
